          Picture this: Your phone rings during a crucial client meeting. You
          tap frantically, but there's that tiny gap between your touch and the
          phone's response. <br />
          That gap—<strong>latency</strong>—is more than a delay. <br />It's
          where professional credibility and user trust hang in the balance.

            <span class="emphasis">The Speed Paradox</span>
            <p>
              Challenging the "faster is better" assumption, we discovered that
              <strong>one-third of users</strong> in network loading scenario
              experienced discomfort with extremely rapid responses.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="finding-item">
            <span class="emphasis">Context Matters</span>
            <p>
              Our research revealed that user tolerance for latency varies
              significantly based on context. During gaming, users prioritized
              consistent <strong>return-to-game speed</strong> over initial
              response time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="finding-item">
            <span class="emphasis">Measurable Impact</span>
            <p>
              Established a logarithmic relationship between latency and
              satisfaction (<strong>R² = 0.68~0.79</strong>), providing clear
              metrics for optimization decisions.

        <!-- <h2>Challenge: How slow is too slow?</h2>
        <p>
          We set out to answer this question by exploring how users experience
          these micro-delays in their daily lives.
        </p> -->

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          We started with a simple question: "How fast should a phone respond?"
          But answering it required both scientific rigor and real-world
          context.
        </p>

        <h2>Sprint 1: Foundation Building (7 weeks)</h2>

        <h3>Stakeholder Alignment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Initial product requirements targeted generic "faster is better"
            approach
          </li>
          <li>
            Pushed back with psychological research on perception thresholds
          </li>
          <li>
            Convinced PM team to support comprehensive user research before
            setting standards
          </li>
          <li>
            Aligned with SDE team on prioritizing perceived performance through
            quality animations
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a testing platform that could precisely control response
            times with engineering team
          </li>
          <li>
            Selected
            <span class="emphasis"> 7 scenarios across three categories</span>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                System interactions (like checking time—something we do 47-82
                times daily!)
              </li>
              <li>In-app settings (complex but focused tasks)</li>
              <li>Network loading (where users expect some waiting)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Twist & Development Constraints</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Engineering team raised concerns about implementation complexity
          </li>
          <li>
            Negotiated focused testing on key interaction points, rather than
            complete task chains
          </li>
          <li>Result: More precise data with fewer development resources</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sprint 2: Initial Study & Surprising Discoveries (4 weeks)</h2>

        <h3>The Tale of Two Users</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>⅔ of users followed our expected pattern: faster = better</li>
          <li>
            ⅓ of users actually reported discomfort with extremely fast
            responses (our "sensitive group")
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Logarithmic Truth</h3>
        <p>
          Discovered a strong logarithmic relationship between latency and
          satisfaction (R² = 0.68~0.79). <br />
          In other words, small delays at the fast end matter more than bigger
          delays at the slow end.
        </p>

        <h2>Sprint 3: Enhanced Study Design (6 weeks)</h2>
        <p>
          Our first study was enlightening but artificial. Time to get real.
        </p>

        <h3>Development & Testing</h3>
        <p>
          I independently developed the web-based testing platform in 2 weeks,
          creating engaging interfaces that felt natural instead of
          experimental.
        </p>

        <h3>1. The Work Rush</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Combined physical dart-throwing with digital check-in</li>
          <li>Physical activity increases latency tolerance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Gaming Interruption</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A scenario where urgent messages interrupt gameplay</li>
          <li>
            Fascinating interaction: Users tolerate slower message-opening if
            game-return is fast
          </li>
          <li>Informed priorities for development team</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Aha Moments: Most Compelling Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Context is King</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Same X00ms delay feels different when gaming versus settings
              </li>
              <li>Physical movement can mask digital delays</li>
              <li>
                Users have different latency expectations based on task urgency
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">The Speed Paradox</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes, too fast is just as bad as too slow</li>
              <li>Animation quality matters as much as speed</li>
              <li>
                Different user groups need different optimization strategies
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact & Future</h2>
        <p>Our findings led to nuanced recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>System interactions: Optimize for X50ms threshold</li>
          <li>Gaming scenarios: Prioritize return-to-game speed</li>
          <li>Consider user-adjustable animation speeds</li>
          <li>Develop context-aware performance modes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If I Were to Do It Again...</h2>
