        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          We embarked on an ambitious mission: transform the insurance claim
          filing experience using AI. But this wasn't just about adding a
          chatbot—it was about rebuilding trust through technology.
        </p>

        <h2>Phase 1: Understanding the Human Side (4 weeks)</h2>
        <h3>Deep Diving into Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Analyzed 1,500+ customer survey responses using thematic analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Identified seven major pain points, with unclear denial reasons
            being the top concern (31%)
          </li>
          <li>
            Mapped the emotional journey of customers through the claims process
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Critical Insight</h3>
        <p>
          We discovered that customers weren't just frustrated with delays—they
          felt lost and unheard. The problem wasn't just technical; it was
          emotional.
        </p>

        <h2>Phase 2: From Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi Prototyping (6 weeks)</h2>
        <h3>Building the Foundation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Created an information architecture focusing on three key paths:
            File a Claim, Track Claim, and Check Policy
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed a self-diagnosis system to empower users with clear,
            actionable information
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated AI-powered suggestions based on previous successful
            claims
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The First Test</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted usability tests with 13 diverse insurance holders,
          focusing on real-world scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fridge leakage claim</li>
          <li>Lost phone scenario</li>
          <li>Phone screen damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Pivot: From Complex to Conversational (5 weeks)</h2>
        <h3>Key Learnings & Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Simplification:</span> Replaced free-form
            text inputs with AI-guided choices, reducing error rates and user
            anxiety
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Real-time Editing:</span> Added message-level
            edit capabilities instead of complex undo functions
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Accessibility:</span> Introduced customizable
            interface options for font size, language, and theme
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Final Prototype</h2>

            target="_blank"
            >view prototype</a
          >) demonstrates:

          <li>Contextual help and real-time guidance throughout the process</li>
          <li>Seamless integration of policy checking and claim tracking</li>
          <li>Customizable interface with accessibility options</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact & Future</h2>
        <p>Our redesign achieved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SUS score of 80.6 ("Excellent"), indicating strong user satisfaction

            Significant cost reduction potential through reduced call center
            load
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>Future enhancements will focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provider matching optimization for on-site services</li>
          <li>Enhanced progress visualization for pending claims</li>
          <li>Expanded accessibility features for diverse user needs</li>
